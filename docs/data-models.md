# Data Models

No explicit data models or database schema were detected in this project. The application appears to be a frontend-only Vue.js application managing state in memory using Pinia.

If a database or persistent data storage is integrated in the future, this document would typically contain:

-   **Database Schema**: A description of the database structure, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships.
-   **Entities/Models**: Definitions of the application's data entities and their attributes.
-   **Migration Strategy**: How database schema changes are managed and applied.
-   **ORM/ODM Usage**: Details on how Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) or Object-Document Mappers (ODMs) are used to interact with the database.
