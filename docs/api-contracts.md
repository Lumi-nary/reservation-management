# API Contracts

No backend API was detected in this project. This application appears to be a frontend-only Vue.js application.

If a backend API is integrated in the future, this document would typically contain:

-   **Endpoint List**: All available API endpoints (e.g., `/api/reservations`, `/api/users`).
-   **HTTP Methods**: The HTTP methods supported for each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
-   **Request/Response Schemas**: Detailed descriptions of the data structures for requests and responses (e.g., JSON payloads).
-   **Authentication/Authorization**: Information on how to authenticate with the API and what authorization rules apply to each endpoint.
-   **Example Requests/Responses**: Illustrative examples of how to interact with the API.
